Global Variables:
- MODELS (dict): A dictionary mapping model names to their corresponding model classes.

Functions:
- get_device(device: str) -> torch.device:
  - Get the torch device based on the specified device string.
  - Parameters:
    - device (str): The device string specifying the desired device ("CUDA if available else CPU", "CUDA", or "CPU").
  - Returns:
    - torch.device: The torch device object.

- load_model(model_name: str, model_filepath: str, device: torch.device) -> torch.nn.Module:
  - Load a pre-trained model from a file.
  - Parameters:
    - model_name (str): The name of the model to load.
    - model_filepath (str): The file path to the saved model.
    - device (torch.device): The torch device to load the model onto.
  - Returns:
    - torch.nn.Module: The loaded pre-trained model.
