Module Documentation: exceptions.py

This module defines two custom exception classes used for specific error handling purposes.

Author:
- Richard Correro (richard@richardcorrero.com)

Classes:
- MalformedDateStringError(Exception)
  - Represents an error that occurs when a date string is malformed or does not adhere to the required format.

- IDNotFoundError(Exception)
  - Represents an error that occurs when an ID is not found or does not exist.

Usage:
- These exception classes can be raised in the code to handle specific error scenarios.
- Use these classes as base classes for custom exceptions or handle them directly in the code where appropriate.

Note:
- No additional functionality or attributes are provided in these exception classes. They serve as markers for specific types of errors.
